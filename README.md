# Victorian Railways Signals for JMRI
## For 2 and 3 Position Signals. 
## Also applies for South Australian Railways (I think, my South Australian ancestry is before railways were invented.)
## Can be used for Semaphores, Searchlights, 3-lamp heads or dwarf discs. The logic is the same, icons displayed only computer control panels will appropriately only display searchlight style.

* sl2h - common two heads
* sl3h - 3 heads, third is C light
* dw1  - Dwarf, single head
