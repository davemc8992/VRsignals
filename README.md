# Victorian Railways Signals for JMRI
Version 3.0  September, 2023  
*Do not use this if you are using earlier versions, they are not compatible.*  
## For 2 and 3 Position Signals used in Victoria, Australia.  
__Also applies for South Australian Railways__  
(I think it applies, my South Australian ancestors were before railways were invented.)

**Can be used for Semaphores, Searchlights, 3-lamp heads or dwarf discs.**  
The logic is the same, icons on computer control panels will only display searchlight style.
